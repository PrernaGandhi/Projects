For internal working of hashMap refer:

When we use map.put we call the constructor, and the hashcode()
if there is an existing value for that hashcode we then call equals().

In case of map.get(), we use hashcode and equals()

If we get the same hashcode and keys are same,  we replace the value
else we connect this node object to the previous node object via linked list and both are stored at index
