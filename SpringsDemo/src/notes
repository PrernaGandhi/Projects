INVERSION OF CONTROL
1.	Create a java pojo class
2.	Create applicationContext.xml
3.	Create main class to run it

The IoC container is responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects. The IoC container gets informations from the XML file and works accordingly. 
The main tasks performed by IoC container are:
	to instantiate the application class
	to configure the object
	to assemble the dependencies between the objects
There are two types of IoC containers. They are:
	BeanFactory
	ApplicationContext
	
If we are using getters and setters, then we use 'properties' tag in bean in 'applicationContext.xml'
else we are using constructors, then we will use 'constructor-arg' tag in bean in 'applicationContext.xml'
